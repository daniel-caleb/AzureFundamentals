Exercise - Create an Azure virtual machine

In this exercise, you create an Azure virtual machine (VM) and install Nginx, a popular web server.

You could use the Azure portal, the Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.

In this instance, you're going to use the Azure CLI.


Task 1: Create a Linux virtual machine and install Nginx


Use the following Azure CLI commands to create a Linux VM and install Nginx. After your VM is created, you'll use the Custom Script Extension to install Nginx. The Custom Script Extension is an easy way to download and run scripts on your Azure VMs. It's just one of the many ways you can configure the system after your VM is up and running.

 Warning

The script in step 1 should update to display the actual resource group once the sandbox is fully loaded. If the Azure Cloud Shell command line interface is available and the resource group in step 1 still shows [sandbox resource group name], go to the previous unit and come back to this unit. The resource group name in step 1 should update and the script will work.


1. From Cloud Shell, run the following az vm create command to create a Linux VM:

```AZURE CLI```
az vm create --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] --name my-vm --public-ip-sku Standard --image Ubuntu2204 --admin-username azureuser --generate-ssh-keys


Your VM will take a few moments to come up. You named the VM my-vm. You use this name to refer to the VM in later steps.

2. Run the following az vm extension set command to configure Nginx on your VM:

```AZURE CLI```
az vm extension set --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] --vm-name my-vm --name customScript --publisher Microsoft.Azure.Extensions --version 2.1 --settings '{"fileUris":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-welcome-to-azure/master/configure-nginx.sh"]}' --protected-settings '{"commandToExecute": "./configure-nginx.sh"}'


This command uses the Custom Script Extension to run a Bash script on your VM. The script is stored on GitHub. While the command runs, you can choose to examine the Bash script from a separate browser tab. To summarize, the script:

Runs apt-get update to download the latest package information from the internet. This step helps ensure that the next command can locate the latest version of the Nginx package.
Installs Nginx.
Sets the home page, /var/www/html/index.html, to print a welcome message that includes your VM's host name.
